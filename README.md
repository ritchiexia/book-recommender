# BOOKCARDS üìòüÉè

### Abstract
Our project makes book recommendations powered by machine learning. Our web app uses a user's reactions towards 18 representative books to match them with a reader in our existing dataset. The user is then presented with books that the machine learning model recommends, using data from the paired user, then prompting the user as to whether they like this book or not. This is done through an interface evocative of modern dating apps like Tinder or Bumble. As the user swipes, they begin to cultivate a list of books they‚Äôve liked, and the underlying machine learning model adapts based on their swipe activity. Thus, as the app is used, the model learns more about the user‚Äôs book tastes, improving its future recommendations.

### Web App Walkthrough/How to Use BookCards
When you open the BookCards app you are greeted by a tutorial card explaining the function of each swipe direction.

Swiping past this, you are then presented with 18 books, chosen to represent a range of genres, which are used to determine which user from the dataset you most resemble. As you swipe your responses are communicated to the backend, which interprets a positive swipe as 5 stars and negative swipe as 0 stars. The set of 18 book-rating pairs are then used to find the user with whom you are most similar to.

This process takes time, so when you swipe on the last book in the representative set, you are presented with a waiting message. The message informs you to wait until the app alerts you that it has completed the pairing process. When the back end has selected a similar user, your browser will alert you. You can now swipe through the books highest ranked for this user.

As you swipe, the reinforcement learning model trains itself to improve the books that it will recommend to you. The books you swipe right on get added to a saved books list available through a button at the top right corner. By clicking the check box on the top right of each card and switching back to the home page, by clicking the centrosaurus icon on the top left, the user is able to delete that book from the saved list.

That‚Äôs it! Using BookCards is a simple and easy way to get personalized book recommendations, where your next read may only be a swipe away!

### Component Descriptions
#### Frontend
The frontend component of the project is evocative of Tinder where each card consists of a book‚Äôs title, author, and the front cover. Each card can be swiped in a certain direction to record the user‚Äôs preference on that entry. The user can swipe in four directions:
- Right: The recommended book seems interesting and the user would likely want to read it. This sends a positive response to the back end and adds the book to the user‚Äôs reading list.
- Left/Down: The user doesn‚Äôt find the recommended book interesting and would not see themself reading it. This sends a negative response to the back end.
- Up: The user has read the current book and enjoyed it. This sends a positive response to the back end, but doesn‚Äôt add the book to the user‚Äôs reading list.
The front end was developed with React, and consists of 3 main components: App, BookCards, and SavedList. BookCards and SavedList are passed props from App to hold the states of the current list of books to recommend, the list of saved books, and the functions to update the states. (For more detailed explanations, please refer to the comments in the GitHub repository)
##### App
App.js contains code that determines which subcomponent to render, and, as aforementioned, the states of book lists. To determine the current page to render, there is a separate state that contains a boolean for whether the user wants to view their saved books. To toggle between the main page with the book cards and the saved list, a header is inserted at the top of the page. Upon clicking either the centrosaurus icon or the saved book icon, a function will be called to update the boolean state accordingly. The header is a simple flex box with a row flex direction and the SavedList icon is from the material-ui React component. A ternary statement persistently checks the state of the boolean, and therefore renders the correct component.
##### BookCards
BookCards.js is the main page where users are shown books and where they can input their sentiments. The cards and swiping motion are from a React component called react-tinder-card (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-tinder-card). Upon swiping on a card, a switch statement handles the direction of the swipe and sends information to the back end through the API (the format will be explained in the API section). Additionally, the book lists are both updated upon swiping the cards by using their respective set functions (a part of the React component) and removing or adding the current book. When the card stack is emptied, a call is made to fetch the next 5 books to recommend. For the style of the book cards, a large influence comes from Tinder. The shape of each entry is modified to better fit the common aspect ratio of books. The book‚Äôs title and author are aligned a distance away from the bottom of the entry and have a shadow to ensure the white font can be seen on bright covers.
##### SavedList
When toggled, SavedList renders the user‚Äôs current saved books in a vertical list. SavedList is passed the savedBooks prop from App, and displays each entry using the map() function. It displays the book title, author, cover, and a checkbox for each entry in the list. Upon clicking on the checkbox, the selected entry is removed from the saved list by calling a helper function that utilizes the saved list‚Äôs set function. The styling of SavedList is a container in the centre of the screen, and each entry is a flexbox. Additional code is added to display a neater scrollbar rather than the default one.

#### API
The API is a Flask server with two different request options: get and put. The ‚Äòput‚Äô method is used by the front end to send the data to the back end that is necessary for updating the model for each swipe. This includes the user id, the id of the book being swiped on, the sentiment the user chose for that swipe (1 for positive and 0 for negative), and a boolean flag called ‚Äòinit_flag‚Äô which specifies if the swipe is one of the first 20 swipes and therefore the backend is notified to initialize the user‚Äôs model. The ‚Äòget‚Äô method is called when the front end needs 5 more book recommendations. The front end sends a ‚Äòget‚Äô request by using the path ‚Äò/book/<user_id>‚Äô with the specified user id. This function calls a get_recs() function from the back end, converts the returned object into a JSON object, and returns that JSON object back to the server.

#### Dataset
The dataset is created from the ‚Äúgoodbooks-10k‚Äù dataset on GitHub and consists of two parts: the user/book/rating tuples, and the data associated with each book (book title, author, publication date, etc.). Both parts of the dataset have been processed to not include books with no title, not include books in other languages, and have a unique id for each entry. For the book data part of the dataset, we have removed all categories we don‚Äôt need, and have stored the book id, book title, author, and image URL for each book in the dataset on the Mongo server. We did this by reading the csv file to a Pandas dataframe, removing the unnecessary columns, converting the data frame to a dictionary, creating a Mongo collection for the book data, and inserting the entire dictionary to that Mongo collection. This improves the overall efficiency of the application.

#### Embedding Model
The Embedding Model is the first machine learning component of the project and is used for the foundation of much of the work the later Reinforcement Learning (RL) model does. The Embedding Model is used to generate both the user vectors and the book feature matrix that the RL model uses to make its predictions. Additionally, it produces the 2 dimensional matrix that is used in the pairing process.
The Model itself consists of two Embedding Layers and a Dropout Layer used in training. The first embedding layer is used to generate and store the embeddings for each user in the dataset, while the second embedding layer does the same but for books. The result of the forward call on the model is computed by taking both user and book indices as input, and calculating the dot product of their resulting embedding. This dot product is then used as input to a sigmoid function, and multiplied by 5.5 to bring it to scale with the ratings.
During training a stochastic gradient descent optimizer was used, alongside a learning rate scheduler which adjusted the learning rate after each batch. We found the best training parameters for this task to be an initial learning rate of 10-6, an optimizer momentum of 0.75, a max learning rate of 0.1, a batch size of 32, and a total training duration of 20 epochs. To combat overfitting observed during initial training sessions, the Dropout layer was set to a dropout probability of 0.25 and applied to both embeddings. Using Mean Square Error as our loss function, we were able to minimize our loss to 0.67, meaning the model predicted ratings within 0.8 stars on average.
From this model, the embedding layers are extracted as 2 dimensional tensors, and after some dimension manipulation, multiplied together to produce a 2 dimensional tensor of ratings, with book_id, and user_id as indices. This matrix is necessary for the pairing logic, which compares the absolute difference between the swipes sent by the frontend user during pairing, and how all the users in our dataset rated that book. Once the paired user is found, we index into the user embedding layer of the model using the paired user‚Äôs id as an index to extract their embedding; we call this embedding the user feature vector. Additionally, the two dimensional tensor representation of the book embedding bag is extracted to allow for mappings between a book‚Äôs id and it‚Äôs embedding in the RL model.

#### Reinforcement Learning Model
The Reinforcement Learning Model is similar to the embedding model, but is much simpler and is actively used when the app is running. The RL model has only one layer: an embedding layer initialized with the weights of the user feature vector found above. The RL model also uses an external matrix, the aforementioned tensor representation of the book embedding bag, which it takes as input to it‚Äôs forward function. This matrix is kept external to the model since it‚Äôs a large unchanging matrix common to all users. During the forward operation of this model, the dot product between the embedding for the book, which is extracted from this matrix, and the stored user feature vector is computed, and put through a sigmoid function before being output.
Upon setting up a new user, the RL model is used to compute the ratings for all books in the dataset - ratings which are then used to order the books. As the app is used, a subset of 300 books are repeatedly re-ranked and reordered to ensure the user is always getting the best recommendation. A subset of 300 is used as it is large enough to ensure that the first books will be rated well but small enough to not be too costly to continuously resort. Books are sent from this list to the front end in batches of 5, and when this subset is 200 books long or less it grabs an additional 100 from the head of the ranked list of all books. This ranking occurs without input from the user, and with the model in evaluation mode.
As the user swipes, the model runs in training mode to learn by comparing its predictions against their swipe, and improve it‚Äôs rating. Using a stochastic gradient descent optimizer with a learning rate of 1 and a momentum value of 0.3, the model trains by comparing its current prediction for a book, the probability a user will like it, with whether or not the user actually swiped. This loss is used immediately to retrain the model before the next swipe.
